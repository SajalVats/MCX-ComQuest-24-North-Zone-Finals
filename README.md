## Introduction

This project presents a case study analysis of India's edible oil import and export policies, with a focus on the impact of import duty reductions and export duty increases. It also examines how global disruptions, such as conflicts affecting shipping routes, impact import prices and strategies.

## Articles

### Article 1: India Keeps Edible Oil Import Duty Lower Until March 2025 and Imposes 50% Export Tax on Molasses

- **Reasons for 50% Export Tax on Molasses**: The tax ensures availability for domestic ethanol production, especially with a projected 10% drop in sugar production due to lower rainfall.
- **Reasons for Low Edible Oil Import Duties**: To control domestic prices. Despite being the worldâ€™s largest importer, India's edible oil imports dropped 16% YOY due to high export duties by exporting nations.

### Article 2: India's Sunflower Oil Imports to Falter as Red Sea Attacks Lift Freight Costs

- **Impact of Red Sea Attacks**: The attacks have led to increased freight costs, causing sunflower oil prices to rise and reducing its import share.
- **Alternative Strategies**: India is expected to increase soybean oil imports from South America to compensate for the shortfall.

## Economic Impact Analysis

- **Decrease in Import Duty**: Leads to lower prices for consumers and increased import volumes, resulting in a net welfare gain for the economy.
- **Increase in Export Duty**: The economic impact varies based on the country's export market share. For small countries, it leads to a net welfare loss; for large countries, the impact is ambiguous and depends on the level of duty imposed.

## Hedging Strategies

- **Commodity Derivatives**: Edible oil companies can use futures and options contracts to hedge against price volatility caused by global disruptions.
  - **Long Futures Contract**: Locks in purchase prices, ensuring no profit or loss from price changes.
  - **Long Call Option**: Provides protection against rising prices while allowing potential benefits from price drops.
